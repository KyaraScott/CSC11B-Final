# CSC11B-Final
Final Project Video Game I made with 3 other people in 2 weeks(4 school days)
The project started off a bit rocky, we had trouble figuring out what we wanted to do, what API we wanted to use, and how to go about creating this game.
We decided to use the Slick API, which was very difficult to use. 
In the end, we decided to program a simple game that required the player to pick up coins and when they were done, they'd receive a congratulations screen with music playing.
We were able to implement a start screen and a congratulations screen. We also were able to get music to play on the menu screen, during the game, and after the player won. 
This project was written on the Eclispe IDE.
